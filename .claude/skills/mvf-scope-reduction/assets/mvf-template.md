# MVF: [Feature Name]

## Core Job-to-Be-Done

When [circumstance describing the situation], [user type] wants to [motivation/desired action], so they can [expected outcome/benefit].

**Frequency:** [How often this job arises: daily, weekly, monthly, etc.]

**Current Pain:** [The primary bottleneck or problem in the current approach]

**Stakes:** [What's at risk / cost of current approach - quantify if possible]

## Success Criteria

How we'll know this MVF succeeded:

- [ ] **[Measurable outcome 1]** - [How measured, target number]
- [ ] **[Measurable outcome 2]** - [How measured, target number]
- [ ] **[Observable behavior]** - [Specific user action we expect to see]
- [ ] **[Adoption metric]** - [Usage target: X% of users, Y times per week, etc.]

**Primary Success Target:** [Most important quantified goal, e.g., "Reduce process time from 30 minutes to 5 minutes" or "80% of users complete task without support"]

## Intentionally Deferred Features

These capabilities are explicitly deferred to future versions, not rejected.

| Feature | Rationale for Deferral | Reconsider When |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------|
| [Feature/Capability X] | [Why deferred: low frequency, edge case, secondary job, automation of manual process, etc.] | [Trigger for reconsideration: usage metric, user request pattern, validation milestone] |
| [Feature/Capability Y] | [Rationale] | [Trigger] |
| [Integration with Z] | [Rationale] | [Trigger] |
| [Admin/Management Features] | [Rationale] | [Trigger] |

**Deferred Enhancements:**
- [Enhancement 1] - [Brief rationale]
- [Enhancement 2] - [Brief rationale]

## Learning Questions

By shipping this MVF, we will learn:

1. **[Question about usage patterns]** - [What we're trying to discover]
2. **[Question about value delivered]** - [What metrics will tell us]
3. **[Question about priorities]** - [What user behavior will reveal]
4. **[Question about deferred features]** - [Do users actually need them?]

**Key Uncertainty:** [The biggest assumption we're testing with this MVF]

## Scope Reduction Rationale

### Original Proposal
[Brief summary of the full scope originally proposed, including all major capabilities]

### Why We Reduced Scope

**Core job identified:** [The specific job-to-be-done that emerged from discovery]

**Primary pain point:** [The critical bottleneck that MVF addresses]

**Capabilities included because:**
- [Capability X] - [Why it's core to solving the job]
- [Capability Y] - [Why it's core to solving the job]
- [Capability Z] - [Why it's core to solving the job]

**Capabilities deferred because:**
- [Deferred item 1] - [Specific reason: frequency, edge case, manual acceptable, etc.]
- [Deferred item 2] - [Specific reason]
- [Deferred item 3] - [Specific reason]

**Scope reduction pattern used:** [e.g., "Read-only before read-write", "Manual before automated", "Single persona first", "Happy path only"]

### Stakeholder Agreement

**Stakeholder:** [Name and role]

**Confirmation:** [Name] confirmed on [date] that this MVF scope:
- Solves the core problem
- Delivers meaningful value even without deferred capabilities
- Is preferable to waiting for a comprehensive solution
- Provides a foundation for learning what to build next

**Quote (if available):** "[Stakeholder's words about the MVF]"

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Scope
[High-level technical approach, key technologies, integrations required]

### Estimated Effort
- **Development:** [X weeks]
- **Testing:** [Y days]
- **Total timeline:** [Z weeks to production]

### Dependencies
- [Dependency 1]
- [Dependency 2]

### Risks
- [Risk 1] - [Mitigation]
- [Risk 2] - [Mitigation]

## Post-Launch Plan

### Monitoring (First 2 Weeks)
- Track: [Specific metrics]
- Watch for: [User behaviors or issues]
- Daily check-in: [With whom]

### User Feedback Collection
- [Method 1: e.g., in-app survey]
- [Method 2: e.g., user interviews with X users]
- [Method 3: e.g., support ticket analysis]

### Decision Points

**After 2 weeks:** Review [metrics] and decide on [decision]

**After 1 month:** Evaluate whether to:
- Proceed with planned v2 features
- Pivot based on usage patterns
- Add different capabilities based on feedback

**After 3 months:** Reassess all deferred features based on:
- User requests and frequency
- Observed usage patterns
- Business priorities
