# Workflow Interview Question Library

Load this file when you need deeper question options for conducting workflow mapping interviews. This complements the quick reference in SKILL.md with comprehensive question lists for each phase.

## Phase 1: Select a Recent Instance

### Opening Questions
- "Can you think of the most recent time you completed [process]?"
- "Tell me about what happened yesterday/last week when you [process]."
- "Walk me through the last instance of this—what day was it?"
- "When was the last time you had to do this? What triggered it?"

### Grounding in Specificity
- "What day and time approximately did this happen?"
- "Who else was there or involved?"
- "What were you working on right before this came up?"
- "Was this a typical example, or was something unusual about it?"

### Avoiding Generalizations
When they say "usually" or "typically":
- "That's helpful context—now what did you do THIS specific time?"
- "Help me understand this one instance—we can talk about variations later."
- "I want to make sure I understand the real process, not the ideal one."

## Phase 2: Map the Linear Flow

### Starting the Sequence
- "What was the very first thing you did?"
- "Before you could start, what information did you need to have?"
- "How did you know it was time to begin this process?"
- "What told you this needed to be done?"

### Following the Steps
- "What did you do next?"
- "And after that?"
- "Then what happened?"
- "Walk me through each thing you did, one by one."

### Uncovering Details
- "When you say 'I reviewed it'—what does that actually mean? What did you look at?"
- "What were you looking for when you did that?"
- "How did you do that specifically? Show me."
- "What tool or system did you use?"
- "Where is that information stored?"

### Understanding Completion
- "How did you know you were done with that step?"
- "What signals completion?"
- "What happens next after this step?"
- "How do you hand this off or move forward?"

### Ordering and Dependencies
- "Why did you do it in that order?"
- "Could you have skipped this step?"
- "What would happen if you did steps X and Y in reverse order?"
- "Can any of these steps happen in parallel?"

## Phase 3: Identify Actors and Handoffs

### Discovering Other People
- "Who else was involved in this process?"
- "At what point did you need someone else?"
- "Did you have to wait for anyone?"
- "Who did you communicate with during this?"
- "Did anyone review your work? Approve it? Sign off on it?"

### Understanding Handoffs
- "What exactly did you send them?"
- "How did you communicate with them?" (email, Slack, in person, scheduled meeting)
- "What information did they need from you?"
- "Did you have to explain anything, or did they already know?"
- "What format was it in?" (spreadsheet, document, verbal, system notification)

### Waiting and Timing
- "How long does that usually take?"
- "How long did it take this time?"
- "What's the fastest you've seen? The slowest?"
- "What determines how long they take?"
- "Do they always respond in time?"

### When Things Go Wrong
- "What happens if they don't respond?"
- "What if they ask for changes?"
- "How do you follow up?"
- "What if they disagree with your approach?"
- "Is there an escalation path?"

### Understanding Their Work
- "What do they do with what you gave them?"
- "What are they checking for?"
- "Why do they need to be involved?"
- "Could this be automated, or does it need their judgment?"

## Phase 4: Uncover Decision Points

### Identifying Branches
- "You said 'if [condition]'—tell me more about that decision."
- "You said 'sometimes'—when is it one way versus another?"
- "You mentioned 'it depends'—what does it depend on?"
- "What determines which path you take?"

### Exploring All Options
- "What are all the possible options at this point?"
- "Is it just yes/no, or are there other paths?"
- "Walk me through what happens in each scenario."
- "Have you ever encountered a situation that didn't fit these categories?"

### Understanding Criteria
- "What information do you use to make that decision?"
- "Is this a judgment call, or are there clear rules?"
- "What makes something qualify as [category]?"
- "Where are those rules documented?"
- "Do different people make this decision differently?"

### Edge Cases and Exceptions
- "What's the weirdest situation you've encountered?"
- "What do you do when the rules don't cover the situation?"
- "What if the information you need isn't available?"
- "Who can override this decision?"
- "What happens if you're not sure which path to take?"

### Quantifying Frequency
- "How often does each path happen?"
- "What's the most common scenario?"
- "Are some paths much rarer than others?"

## Phase 5: Discover Bottlenecks and Pain Points

### Time and Duration
- "Which step takes the longest?"
- "Where do you spend the most time?"
- "Where do you find yourself waiting?"
- "What's the fastest you've ever completed this end-to-end?"
- "What's the slowest it's taken? What caused that?"
- "If you're rushed, which parts do you rush through?"

### Frustration and Difficulty
- "What's the most annoying part of this process?"
- "Which step makes you think 'there has to be a better way'?"
- "What do you dread about this process?"
- "If you could eliminate one step, which would it be?"
- "What feels like unnecessary work?"

### Errors and Mistakes
- "Where do mistakes usually happen?"
- "What's easy to get wrong?"
- "What do you have to double-check?"
- "Have you ever had to redo work? Why?"
- "What causes quality issues?"

### System and Tool Problems
- "Where do you find yourself switching between multiple tools?"
- "What information do you have to look up more than once?"
- "What do you need to copy and paste?"
- "What do you have to manually re-enter?"
- "Which systems don't talk to each other?"
- "When do systems crash or go down?"

### Communication Breakdowns
- "Where do you find yourself having to explain things repeatedly?"
- "What information gets lost in handoffs?"
- "Where do people misunderstand what you need?"
- "Do you ever get conflicting information?"
- "What questions do people always ask you?"

### Workarounds and Shortcuts
- "Have you developed any shortcuts?"
- "How do you handle this when [system] is down?"
- "Is there a faster way you use in a pinch?"
- "What do you do differently when you're under time pressure?"
- "What 'unofficial' ways have you found to make this easier?"
- "Do you ever skip steps? Which ones and why?"

### Impact Quantification
- "How often does this problem occur?"
- "How much time does it cost you?"
- "How much time does it cost the team/company?"
- "How many people are affected by this?"
- "What's the cost if this goes wrong?"
- "Does this ever cause you to miss deadlines?"

## Phase 6: Validate and Complete the Model

### Playback and Confirmation
- "Let me walk through what I heard—is this accurate?"
- "So you start by [X], then [Y], then [Z]—is that right?"
- "Did I capture the decision points correctly?"
- "Did I miss anything in the sequence?"

### Finding Gaps
- "What did I miss?"
- "What else happens during this process?"
- "Are there any parallel processes happening at the same time?"
- "What monitoring or reporting happens alongside this?"
- "What documentation or record-keeping occurs?"

### Variation and Alternatives
- "Does everyone do it this way?"
- "Do other teams/departments handle this differently?"
- "How do new people learn this process?"
- "Is this written down anywhere?"
- "What tribal knowledge am I missing?"
- "What's the 'official' process versus what really happens?"

### Comparative Understanding
- "How did you do this before [system/change]?"
- "Has this process changed recently?"
- "How do competitors do this?" (if they know)
- "What would the 'textbook' version look like versus reality?"

### Future-State Thinking (Optional)
- "If you could redesign this from scratch, what would you change?"
- "What would make this twice as fast?"
- "What would eliminate the need for this entirely?"
- "If you had unlimited resources, how would you do this?"

### Finding Other Stakeholders
- "Who else should I talk to about this?"
- "Who else does this process?"
- "Who would have a different perspective?"
- "Who experiences the pain points most?"
- "Who receives the output of this process?"

## Red Flag Questions

### When they say: "We just know how to do it"
- "Help me become the newest team member—what would you teach me first?"
- "What's not written down that someone needs to know?"
- "How did you learn this?"

### When they say: "It's different every time"
- "Show me the last 3 times—what was similar? What was different?"
- "What stays constant?"
- "What are the things that always have to happen?"

### When they say: "It depends on [person]"
- "What does [person] know that others don't?"
- "How did they learn it?"
- "What happens when they're not available?"
- "Could anyone else make this decision?"

### When they say: "The system is broken so we work around it"
- "Show me both—the official way and your workaround."
- "Which is faster? Which is more accurate?"
- "Why doesn't everyone use your workaround?"
- "Does management know about this workaround?"

### When they say: "That's just how we've always done it"
- "What would break if we stopped doing this step?"
- "Who would notice if we skipped it?"
- "Why was this started in the first place?"
- "Is there a regulation or policy that requires this?"
